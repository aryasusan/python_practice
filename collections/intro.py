# int marks = new marks[5]
# marks[0] = 10
# marks[1] = 20
# marks[2] = 30
# marks[3] = 40
# marks[4] = 50
# marks[5] = 60

# array stores only homogenous data,that is here only integer values can be stored
# (marks array is declared as int)
# to overcome this, we use collections where heterogeneous data can be stored
# lst=[10,10.6,'arya',true]

# 4 Types of collections:

# 1. List
# 2. Tuple
# 3. Set
# 4. Dictionary

# Properties:

# 1. How to define?
# 2. Heterogeneous dat allowed or not?
# 3. Duplicate values allowed or not?
# 4. Insertion order is preserved or not?-if entered values are inserted in the same order or is it random?
# 5. Mutable or immutable?- if values can be changed or not?
