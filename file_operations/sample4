Empire of the Sultans was a touring exhibition from 1995 to 2004 displaying
objects from the Khalili Collection of Islamic Art. Around two hundred exhibits,
including calligraphy, textiles, pottery (example pictured), weapons, and metalwork,
illustrated the art and daily life of six centuries of the Ottoman Empire. Many of the
objects had been created for the leaders of the empire, the sultans. Two of the
calligraphic pieces were the work of sultans themselves. In the 1990s, the exhibition
was hosted by institutions in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Israel, and its first
catalogue was published by J. M. Rogers. The exhibits visited thirteen cities in the
United States from 2000 to 2004, despite controversies in the wake of the September 11
attacks and the Iraq War.
